# Movies Collection Application

This project was generated using [Nx](https://nx.dev).

The concept behind this application is to show how to approach different solutions in Angular application. This
application is about a movie collection, with the ability to browse and search through movies. I have used NgRX for
state management which provides app scalability. Code is well separated and responsibilities of features are limited to
their task. Some solutions sometimes might be little bit overkill but this app is about showing various solutions.

## How to run this app
